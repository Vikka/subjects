## Setup

[Install requirements][SA-install requirements.txt with pip]
(with [pip][pip tutorial on youtube]):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run test suite

### On a specific folder

This is an example, and a good start.

```shell
pytest exercises/function
# or
python -m pytest exercises/function
```

### On all folders

Note: You will get a lot of errors if not all required functions are
implemented.

```shell
pytest
# or
python -m pytest
```

# Rules

## Respect PEP 8 style

PEP 8 is a style guide for Python. You can find it [here][PEP 8 page].

Since you aren't allowed to use some of python features, you should test your
code with custom rules. This project has a `setup.cfg` file with
a [flake8][flake8 page] configuration, so you can run `flake8` to check your
code with properly excluded errors.

```shell
flake8
# or
python -m flake8
```
