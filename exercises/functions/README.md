# Functions

exercise 1:
```txt
Create a function "my_add" that takes two integers and returns their sum.

    Exemple:
        >>> my_add(1, 2)
        3

    Hint:
        - You can use the "+" operator.
        - This function is a training function, it won't be very useful later, but at least you can
          try to make it work.

exercise 2:
```txt
Create a function "my_sum" that takes 4 integers and returns their sum.

    Exemple:
        >>> my_sum(1, 2, 3, 4)
        6
        >>> my_sum(7, 8, 9, 10)
        34

    Hints:
        - Try to use the "my_add" function in the "my_sum" function instead of the "+" operator.
        - If you name a function as a builtin function, you are shadowing it and this will be
          penalized with -10 points per call.
        - This function is a training function, it won't be very useful later, but at least you can
          try to make it work.
