# Practice with functions

## Summary

- [Exercise 1: my_add][exercise 1 header]
- [Exercise 2: my_sum][exercise 2 header]

## Exercises

### [Exercise 1: my_add][summary header]

Create a function "my_add" that takes two integers and returns their sum.

#### Exemple:

```shell
>>> my_add(1, 2)
3
```

#### Hints:

- You can use the `+` operator.
- This function is a training function, it won't be very useful later, but at
  least you can practice function definition.

### [Exercise 2: my_sum][summary header]

Create a function "my_sum" that takes 4 integers and returns their sum.

#### Exemple:

```shell
>>> my_sum(1, 2, 3, 4)
6
>>> my_sum(7, 8, 9, 10)
34
```

#### Hints:

- Try to use the `my_add` function in the `my_sum` function instead of 
  the `+` operator.
- If you name a function as a builtin function, you are shadowing it and this 
  will be penalized with `-1` points per call.
- This function is a training function, it won't be very useful later, but at
  least you can practice function call.
